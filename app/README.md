# Hawkins Resume App

This is a simple node.js app to redirect users to the latest version of my resume. This way, I can deploy this app and simply link download buttons and recruiters to my app's URL in order to download the latest resume at any time.

## Example

Assume the app is deployed to `https://hawkins-resume.now.sh`.

A download link could be added to any webpage like so: `<a href="https://hawkins-resume.now.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Download latest resume</a>`

## Deploying

Deploy to [ZEIT's Now.sh](https://now.sh) with `now`, then apply alias and scaling with `now alias`.
